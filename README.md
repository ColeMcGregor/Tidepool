# Tidepool 

**Tidepool** is a tile-based exploration game about chasing the ocean as it recedes, uncovering hidden pools of shells and sea life, and racing back before the tide returns.

##  Gameplay

- **Explore the beach** as the tide goes out, revealing wet sand, pools, and treasures.  
- **Collect** shells, starfish, crabs, pearls, fossils, and more.  
- **Navigate terrain**:
  - Dry/Wet Sand: walkable
  - Pools: collectable
  - Water: requires swimming
  - Boulder: must go around
