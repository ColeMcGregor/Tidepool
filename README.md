# Tidepool
Tidepool is a tile-based exploration game where players chase the receding tide to uncover pools filled with shells and sea life. Collect treasures from exposed pools while avoiding boulders and racing against the returning tide—get caught, and you’ll lose most of your haul. Treasures can be turned in for character customizables
